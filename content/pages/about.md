In a nutshell, I am a passionate self-taught who seeks to bring her skills to create things that can serve as a tool for others.
I believe a lot in education and in the power of continuous learning.
Like many other people, I've also learned (and continue to learn) web development on a self-taught basis.
But I'm not only interested in that. I really like sports, philosophy, mathematics, design, neuroscience, among other things. In short, I am a curious person who questions a lot and asks questions constantly. Everything that I am, I want to gather and offer to others. Only that.
